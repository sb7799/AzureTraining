    <h4>Why are federal/government hospitals important for healthcare?</h4>
    <h6>Federal/government hospitals offer healthcare services to specific patient populations, such as active military members. Additionally, these facilities often provide care for free or at a discount for the patients they serve.</h6>
    <h6>Federal hospitals not only offer healthcare to specific populations but also improve overall health by helping these patients prevent other health conditions from occurring through early interventions. </h6>
